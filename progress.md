# Progress Log

## Current Verified State

- Last Updated: 2026-07-14
- Repository root: `D:\Snowflake Hackathon\climate-agriculture-copilot`
- Current Objective: **Project pivoted 2026-07-14** to `docs/FarmTwin-AI-Copilot.md`
  (single farm, 4 heterogeneous Farm Assets — Fish Pond/Chicken Coop/Rice
  Field/Fruit Orchard — isometric digital twin, AI-Copilot-centric UI,
  structured 6-field recommendations). `feature_list.json` was rewritten
  around this new roadmap (`feat-008` through `feat-019`). The prior
  rice-cooperative build's evidence is preserved below under "Legacy:
  rice-cooperative build (superseded 2026-07-14)" — nothing was deleted,
  the roadmap moved forward per the user's explicit choice. See
  `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/ui-build-plan.md` for the current
  target design and the schema/API mapping from old to new.
- Standard startup path: `./init.sh`
- Standard verification path: `cd backend && python -m compileall app`
  (syntax-only). A real venv exists at `backend/venv` with
  `requirements.txt` installed, so runtime verification is also possible.
  Frontend verification: `cd frontend && npm run build && npm run lint`.
- Highest-priority unfinished feature: `feat-021` — shared frontend
  data-fetch cache/hook (`feat-020`, the backend connection-reuse fix,
  is `passing` as of Session 016).
- Blockers: none currently known.
- Recommended Next Step: Work `feat-021`, then `feat-022` through
  `feat-029` in priority order.

## Session 015 — new roadmap: performance + split-screen UX + visual polish

- Date: 2026-07-14
- The FarmTwin pivot (`feat-008`–`feat-019`) reached feature-complete at
  the end of Session 014. The user then requested 3 improvements: (1)
  the dashboard loads slowly — cache or use hooks; (2) restructure the
  home screen into a split view (map left, dashboard-or-selected-asset
  right, with a back button) instead of separate map/dashboard/
  asset-detail pages; (3) make the UI look more like real farm
  infrastructure with better graphics/animation, and build a feature
  list for it.
- Before drafting the list, investigated #1 rather than taking the
  user's diagnosis (frontend caching) at face value: read
  `backend/app/services/snowflake_client.py` and `GET /dashboard/summary`
  in `backend/app/main.py`. Found `get_connection()` opens a brand-new
  Snowflake connection (full auth + session-init + warehouse-resume
  handshake) for *every single query*, and `/dashboard/summary` alone
  issues 4 sequential queries — so one dashboard load pays that full
  handshake cost 4 times. This is almost certainly the dominant cause of
  "slow," not a lack of frontend caching. Both are now on the roadmap:
  `feat-020` (backend connection reuse — the real primary fix) and
  `feat-021` (frontend shared-cache hook — the user's original ask,
  still valuable for repeat-navigation latency, not a substitute for
  feat-020).
- Asked the user 3 clarifying questions via `AskUserQuestion` before
  scoping #2 and #3 (per the user's own "ask me if you need more
  information" and this repo's precedent from the original pivot
  session). Answers, all confirmed 2026-07-14:
  1. **Split-screen layout scope:** replace the home page (`/`) entirely
     — map docked left, right panel defaults to dashboard content and
     swaps in-place to asset detail on click, `/assets/{id}` stays a
     working deep-link, `/dashboard` redirects to `/`. (Not a new
     parallel route, not dropping `/assets/{id}` as a URL.)
  2. **Animation approach:** stay dependency-free — plain CSS/SVG
     animation, no new library (no Framer Motion, no canvas/game
     engine). Matches this project's established minimal-dependency
     bias from every prior frontend session.
  3. **Visual style:** cute/cartoon farm-sim, Stardew-Valley/Hay-Day
     adjacent — warm, friendly, illustrated look, not photorealistic or
     a leveled-up version of the current minimal isometric style.
- Wrote 10 new features into `feature_list.json` (`feat-020` through
  `feat-029`, all `not_started`), continuing the existing structure/
  rigor (dependencies, verification steps, notes) rather than a separate
  document:
  - `feat-020`: backend connection reuse (the perf root-cause fix).
  - `feat-021`: shared frontend data-fetch cache/hook, hand-rolled, no
    new dependency.
  - `feat-022`: the split-screen Farm view itself (map + dashboard/
    asset-detail panel + back button), replacing `/` and `/dashboard`.
  - `feat-023`: cartoon terrain redesign (grass/paths/sky/landmarks) —
    the foundational visual pass the per-asset graphics sit on top of.
  - `feat-024`–`feat-027`: one feature per asset type (fish pond pond+
    fish+water-tint, chicken coop+chickens, rice paddy+growth-stage
    visuals, orchard trees+fruit-ripeness visuals), each CSS/SVG
    animated and tied to real backend data (risk level, growth_stage,
    harvest_readiness_pct) rather than purely decorative.
  - `feat-028`: weather ambience overlay (rain/clouds/sun tint driven by
    real `WEATHER_READINGS`) — flagged as lowest-priority/droppable if
    time-constrained, since it's atmosphere-only, no status information.
  - `feat-029`: expressive per-status animation (pulse on the top-risk
    asset, alert bubble, healthy sparkle) replacing the current static
    colored ring, closing the loop on `ui-build-plan.md`'s original
    "should read as alive" note.
- No code changed yet this session — planning/scoping only, matching
  this repo's precedent (Session 010's pivot was also planning-only
  before implementation began).
- Next best step: `feat-020` (backend connection-reuse fix) — highest
  priority, smallest/lowest-risk change, and the correct fix for the
  originally reported "dashboard loads slowly" complaint.

## Session 011

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Goal: Run and verify `feat-008` (Snowflake schema rebuild) and `feat-009`
  (semantic view + Cortex Agent rebuild) — both require the user to run
  CoCo interactively, per `CLAUDE.md`; this agent cannot run CoCo itself.
- User ran all 4 Part 2 prompts in `snowflake/coco-prompts.md` against the
  live account: schema rebuild, seed data, semantic view, Cortex Agent.
  Results recorded in that file by the user.
- Verified `feat-008` independently (not just trusting CoCo's self-report),
  same rigor as the original build's sessions: queried the live account via
  `backend/venv` — `FARM_ASSETS`=4 rows (one per asset_type, with real
  `grid_x`/`grid_y`/`install_date`), `ASSET_READINGS`=120 rows (30 days x 4
  assets, type-specific columns populated, irrelevant columns NULL per
  type), `ASSET_RISK_ASSESSMENTS`=22 rows (confirmed the fish pond's DO
  escalation to `critical`), `ASSET_HISTORY`=12 rows (confirmed the Q4-2024
  biomass crash 310kg -> 145kg). `DESCRIBE TABLE RECOMMENDATIONS` confirmed
  all 12 planned columns. Noted `asset_id`/`recommendation_id` are string
  codes (e.g. `FP-001`), not auto-incrementing numbers, for `feat-010`'s ID
  design.
- Verified `feat-009` independently: called the rebuilt `FARM_OPS_AGENT`
  directly via a Python script using `backend/app/services/
  cortex_agent_client.py`'s endpoint (no code change needed — CoCo rebuilt
  the agent under the same name/schema). First call hit a transient
  `httpx.ReadTimeout` at 90s (same known flakiness as the prior build's
  feat-006 session); retried with a longer client-side timeout and got a
  real response: correctly identified FP-001's critical DO emergency,
  cited exact current sensor values and the Jul 6-12 decline trend,
  cross-referenced the Q4-2024 historical crash from `ASSET_HISTORY`, and
  produced 4 recommendations each containing all 6 required fields
  (Recommendation/Reason/Evidence/Priority/Expected Impact/Confidence)
  with real data citations — not generic advice.
- Result: `feat-008` and `feat-009` both moved to `passing` in
  `feature_list.json` with the above evidence recorded.
- Files updated: `feature_list.json`, `progress.md`. (`snowflake/
  coco-prompts.md`'s Result lines were filled in by the user, not this
  agent.)
- Note for `feat-012` (next backend feature that calls the agent for
  real): the agent emits structured-but-parseable markdown prose (bolded
  field labels), not JSON — parsing needs to extract the 6 fields from
  that format. Keep the 90s+ httpx timeout given the observed flakiness.
- Next best step at the time: `feat-010` (completed later in this same
  session — see below).

### Session 011 (continued) — feat-010

- Goal: Implement `feat-010` — new Pydantic models + Snowflake read layer
  for the asset schema, now that `feat-008`/`feat-009` are `passing`.
- Implemented:
  - `backend/app/models/schemas.py`: replaced `Plot`/`PlotRisk`/
    `WorkOrder`/`RiskAssessment` with `FarmAsset`, `AssetReading` (15
    nullable type-specific fields mirroring `ASSET_READINGS` exactly),
    `AssetRisk`, `AssetHistory`, `Recommendation` (6-field structured
    format + status/approval fields), `ApprovalRequest`, `DailyBriefing`
    v2, `BriefingToday` v2. `WeatherReading` updated to drop `farm_id`
    (table is farm-wide now).
  - `backend/app/main.py`: removed the dead `/plots`, `/plots/{id}/risk`,
    `/workorders/{id}/approve`, `/workorders/{id}/reject` endpoints and
    their helpers (`_overall_risk_level`, `_work_order_from_row`,
    `_set_work_order_status`) — their backing tables no longer exist.
    Stubbed `/workflow/run` and `/briefing/today` with explicit
    `TODO(feat-011/012/013)` comments and placeholder v2 responses,
    matching this repo's existing stub convention.
- Verified (runtime, not just syntax):
  - `python -m compileall app` — clean.
  - Ran a standalone script (scratchpad, not committed) against the live
    account: real `SELECT`s against `FARM_ASSETS` (all 4 rows),
    `ASSET_READINGS`, `ASSET_RISK_ASSESSMENTS`, and `ASSET_HISTORY` for
    `FP-001`, constructing `FarmAsset`/`AssetReading`/`AssetRisk`/
    `AssetHistory` instances from each row — all succeeded, field values
    matched the raw rows exactly, irrelevant nullable columns correctly
    came back `None`.
  - Checked port 8000 was clear, started `uvicorn` against the live
    account, curled `/health`, `/workflow/run`, `/briefing/today` — all
    three returned valid JSON matching the new v2 schemas with clear
    "stubbed pending feat-0XX" summaries. Confirms zero import errors
    against the rewritten models (the real risk this feature could have
    introduced, since the old `main.py` imported classes that no longer
    exist). Killed the uvicorn process afterward.
- Result: `feat-010` moved to `passing` in `feature_list.json` with the
  above evidence recorded.
- Files updated: `backend/app/models/schemas.py`, `backend/app/main.py`,
  `feature_list.json`, `progress.md`.
- Next best step at the time: `feat-011` (completed later in this same
  session — see below).

### Session 011 (continued) — feat-011

- Goal: Implement `feat-011` — a simulation engine for per-asset sensor
  data, since no physical IoT exists for this build.
- Implemented `backend/app/services/asset_simulator.py`:
  `next_reading(asset_type, previous)` — a persisted-last-value + bounded
  random walk per numeric metric (metric-specific min/max/step/drift
  table), plus dedicated logic for `growth_stage` (ordered, one step per
  tick), `irrigation_status` (derived from `soil_moisture_pct`), and
  `egg_count` (small walk around the previous count).
  `dissolved_oxygen_mg_l` gets one extra directional-drift rule (keeps
  declining below 4.0, gently recovers above 6.0) so the fish pond's
  seeded crisis continues realistically across future `/workflow/run`
  calls instead of randomly snapping back to healthy — the one asset the
  demo narrative is built around, not a general framework applied to
  every metric (per the feature's own "don't over-engineer" note).
- Verified (not just syntax):
  - `python -m compileall app` — clean.
  - Ran a 4-scenario seeded-RNG script (scratchpad, not committed): (A)
    fish_pond from the real seeded critical DO (3.5 mg/L) declined
    continuously over 8 ticks to the 2.0 floor, every delta <= 0.39 —
    bounded and trending, not noise; (B) fish_pond from a healthy DO (7.0)
    stayed healthy/rose slightly over 5 ticks; (C) rice_field
    `growth_stage` advanced exactly one stage at a time or held over 20
    ticks, never skipped/reversed; (D) chicken_coop egg count/feed/water
    all evolved smoothly.
- Result: `feat-011` moved to `passing` in `feature_list.json` with the
  above evidence recorded.
- Files updated: `backend/app/services/asset_simulator.py` (new),
  `feature_list.json`, `progress.md`.
- Next best step at the time: `feat-012` (completed later in this same
  session — see below).

### Session 011 (continued) — feat-012

- Goal: Implement `feat-012` — rewrite `/workflow/run` as Observe ->
  Understand -> Recommend -> Predict, wiring `asset_simulator.py`
  (`feat-011`) and the real `FARM_OPS_AGENT` call (`feat-009`) together.
- Implemented:
  - `backend/app/services/risk_engine.py`: `assess_risk()` (Understand —
    rule-based thresholds per asset type, mirroring what the agent itself
    was instructed to use) and `predict_trend()` (Predict — one-sentence
    linear projection when the driving metric is moving in the worsening
    direction since the previous reading).
  - `backend/app/services/recommendation_parser.py`: `parse_recommendations()`
    — line-based regex extraction of the agent's 6 bolded field labels,
    tolerant of formatting variance.
  - `backend/app/main.py`: `/workflow/run` rewritten as Observe (simulate
    + write `ASSET_READINGS`; fetch + write farm-wide `WEATHER_READINGS`)
    -> Understand (write `ASSET_RISK_ASSESSMENTS`) -> Recommend (real
    `FARM_OPS_AGENT` call for medium+ risk assets only, parsed into
    `RECOMMENDATIONS` rows) -> Predict (`ASSET_RISK_ASSESSMENTS` row
    suffixed `_forecast_24h`).
  - `backend/app/config.py`: added `farm_lat`/`farm_lon` — `FARM_ASSETS`
    has no lat/lon post-pivot (one physical farm, not many geo-distributed
    plots), so weather ingestion needs one configured location.
  - `backend/app/services/weather_client.py`: extended
    `get_today_reading()` to also pull `wind_speed_10m_max` (new
    `WEATHER_READINGS.wind_speed_kmh` column).
- Verified (runtime, iteratively, against the live account — not just
  syntax):
  - Ran `/workflow/run` 4 times total while iterating, checking port 8000
    was clear and cleanly killing `uvicorn` between restarts each time.
  - Run 1 (200, 89.6s): `assets_assessed=4`, `high_risk_assets=['FP-001']`
    (only the seeded crisis asset flagged — correct), 3 real
    `RECOMMENDATIONS` rows written. Found the `summary` field leaked the
    agent's raw tool-call narration ahead of an `<answer>` tag.
  - Run 2 hit a genuine `httpx.ReadTimeout` at the 90s client timeout
    (same known flakiness as feat-006/feat-009) — bumped
    `cortex_agent_client.py`'s timeout 90s -> 150s.
  - Discovered the narration-wrapper format isn't consistent across
    calls (sometimes an explicit `<answer>` tag, sometimes narration runs
    straight into the first markdown heading with no tag at all) — fixed
    `_clean_agent_answer()` to handle both shapes plus a no-heading
    fallback, verified against 3 fixture shapes.
  - Runs 3 and 4 (both 200, ~100s) produced clean summaries with zero
    narration leakage. Cross-checked Snowflake directly: correct
    alternating current/forecast `ASSET_RISK_ASSESSMENTS` rows each tick,
    9 total `RECOMMENDATIONS` rows across 3 successful runs (all
    `pending_approval`), table counts grew as expected.
- Result: `feat-012` moved to `passing` in `feature_list.json` with the
  above evidence recorded.
- Files updated: `backend/app/main.py`, `backend/app/config.py`,
  `backend/app/services/risk_engine.py` (new),
  `backend/app/services/recommendation_parser.py` (new),
  `backend/app/services/weather_client.py`,
  `backend/app/services/cortex_agent_client.py`, `feature_list.json`,
  `progress.md`.
- Known non-blocking limitation (documented, not fixed — matches this
  repo's precedent of accepting hackathon-scale limits rather than
  over-engineering): the per-asset loop has no cross-asset
  transaction/rollback. If the agent call for one at-risk asset fails,
  assets later in `ASSET_ID` order simply catch up on the next
  `/workflow/run` call. Each real Cortex Agent call can take 60-150s;
  fine for the demo's one-asset-crisis scope, would serialize badly with
  multiple simultaneous incidents.
- Next best step at the time: `feat-013` (completed later in this same
  session — see below).

### Session 011 (continued) — feat-013

- Goal: Implement `feat-013` — asset read endpoints, recommendation
  approve/reject, dashboard summary, and rebuild `/briefing/today` for
  real (it had been stubbed since `feat-010`).
- Implemented:
  - `backend/app/models/schemas.py`: `AssetOverview`, `AssetDetail`,
    `AssetStatusSummary`, `DashboardSummary`.
  - `backend/app/main.py`: `GET /assets`, `GET /assets/{id}` (404 if
    missing), `GET /assets/{id}/recommendations`, `POST
    /recommendations/{id}/approve|reject` (404 if missing), `GET
    /dashboard/summary` (farm-wide health score, active alerts, tasks due
    today, top recommendations, weather, asset overview), and a real `GET
    /briefing/today` against `RECOMMENDATIONS`. Health score/status are
    derived from `risk_level` via a fixed severity mapping (no stored
    score column).
- Verified (runtime, against the live account):
  - Every new route curled and cross-checked: `/assets` showed FP-001
    correctly critical/10/critical from the real seeded crisis and the
    other 3 healthy/90; `/assets/FP-001` returned the correct reading,
    current risk, `_forecast_24h` prediction, and all 3 history periods;
    `/assets/DOES-NOT-EXIST` correctly 404'd; `/dashboard/summary`'s
    `farm_health_score` was exactly `(90+90+10+90)/4=70` as expected.
  - Approved one FP-001 recommendation (custom `approved_by`) and
    rejected another (default `approved_by`) — both updated correctly;
    approving a non-existent id 404'd. `/briefing/today` then correctly
    reflected both.
  - Found and fixed a real bug: `/briefing/today`'s summary leaked a
    3rd narration shape `_clean_agent_answer` (from `feat-012`) didn't yet
    handle — no `<answer>` tag, no markdown heading, just tool-planning
    sentences joined with zero whitespace flowing straight into the real
    answer. Added `_strip_narration_prefix()` (cuts leading sentences
    starting with known planning lead-ins at the first sentence-ending
    punctuation, looping until clean), verified against the exact
    captured real text plus a negative case (a sentence containing a
    decimal number, correctly left untouched), then re-verified live —
    the next `/briefing/today` call came back with zero narration leakage.
- Result: `feat-013` moved to `passing` in `feature_list.json` with the
  above evidence recorded.
- Files updated: `backend/app/main.py`, `backend/app/models/schemas.py`,
  `feature_list.json`, `progress.md`.
- Next best step at the time: `feat-014` (completed later in this same
  session — see below).

### Session 011 (continued) — feat-014

- Goal: Implement `feat-014` — `POST /copilot/ask`, the free-form Q&A
  endpoint. Last backend feature; frontend work starts after this.
- Implemented `CopilotQuestion`/`CopilotAnswer` in `schemas.py` and `POST
  /copilot/ask` in `main.py` — wraps the user's question with grounding +
  "end with a concrete next step" instructions, calls `FARM_OPS_AGENT`,
  cleans the response with the shared `_clean_agent_answer`.
- Verified live against 3 of the vision doc's example questions
  (representative sample across question shapes, not all 8, given each
  call takes 40-100s): "What should I do today?" correctly triaged all 4
  assets by urgency with real data and a concrete next step; "Should I
  feed the fish?" correctly answered "No," grounded in the real DO trend
  and Q4-2024 history; "How healthy is the farm?" correctly summarized
  all 4 assets by health status. All 3 cleared the vision doc's explicit
  good-vs-bad example bar.
- Found and fixed a 4th narration-leak shape during this verification:
  "I have the data model. Let me pull..." didn't match any existing
  lead-in phrase, so stripping never started. Extended the lead-in list,
  verified against the captured text, then re-ran a question live to
  confirm zero leakage.
- Result: `feat-014` moved to `passing` in `feature_list.json`. **All 7
  backend features (`feat-008`–`feat-014`) are now `passing`** — the
  entire FarmTwin backend pipeline is real and Snowflake/Cortex-backed
  end to end.
- Files updated: `backend/app/main.py`, `backend/app/models/schemas.py`,
  `feature_list.json`, `progress.md`.
- Noted, not acted on: two new untracked files appeared mid-session that
  this agent did not create — `docs/challenge.md` (hackathon judging
  criteria for the Domain-Specific AI Copilot track) and
  `docs/project-structure.md` (a much more elaborate proposed repo layout
  — 20 numbered docs, `prompts/`, `sample-data/`, `tasks/` directories —
  that doesn't match the current structure). Flagged to the user; not
  incorporated into the plan without explicit direction, per the
  one-feature-at-a-time / stay-in-scope rule.
- Next best step at the time: `feat-015` (completed later in this same
  session — see below).

### Session 011 (continued) — feat-015

- Goal: Implement `feat-015` — the isometric Digital Twin home screen
  (first frontend feature), replacing the real Leaflet/OSM Screen 1.
- User confirmed via `AskUserQuestion` mid-session: ignore
  `docs/project-structure.md` (a much larger proposed repo layout that
  appeared as an untracked file — treated as reference material, not a
  directive) and proceed straight to `feat-015`.
- Implemented:
  - `frontend/components/DigitalTwinMap.tsx` (new): plain CSS isometric
    rendering (11x11 diamond ground grid via `clip-path`, standard 2:1
    coordinate transform from `grid_x`/`grid_y`) — no new library, per the
    open decision in `ui-build-plan.md` and matching the prior build's
    bias toward minimal dependencies. One marker per asset (emoji in a
    colored ring), hover popover, click links to `/assets/{id}`.
  - `frontend/lib/api.ts`: full rewrite for the new backend contract.
  - Removed `frontend/components/FarmMap.tsx`, `frontend/app/plots/[id]/`
    (both dead), `npm uninstall leaflet react-leaflet @types/leaflet`.
  - `frontend/app/page.tsx` rewritten as the Digital Twin home.
    `frontend/app/briefing/page.tsx` got a minimal field-rename compat
    patch (not a redesign — that's `feat-019`) to keep the build green.
- Verified (runtime, via Playwright + real backend, not just build):
  - `npm run build` hit a stale generated Next.js typegen file referencing
    the deleted route — cleared `.next/` and rebuilt clean.
    `npm run build` and `npm run lint` both clean after.
  - Installed Playwright fresh into the session scratchpad, ran against
    live `uvicorn` + `next dev`. First attempt (against `127.0.0.1:3000`)
    showed 0 markers — root-caused to a CORS origin mismatch (backend
    defaults to allowing `localhost:3000`), fixed by testing against the
    matching origin. All 4 markers rendered correctly with real data;
    FP-001 showed the correct critical/red ring and real live alert text.
  - Found and fixed a real bug: a hovered tooltip could render partially
    behind a neighboring marker with a higher z-index, clipping text.
    Fixed (hovered marker's z-index bumped above all others), re-verified
    via screenshot.
  - Verified click-through: FP-001 correctly navigates to `/assets/
    FP-001`, which correctly 404s (expected — `feat-017` hasn't landed)
    with no crash.
- Result: `feat-015` moved to `passing` in `feature_list.json`.
- Files updated: `frontend/lib/api.ts`, `frontend/app/page.tsx`,
  `frontend/app/layout.tsx`, `frontend/app/briefing/page.tsx`,
  `frontend/components/DigitalTwinMap.tsx` (new),
  `frontend/package.json` + `package-lock.json`, `feature_list.json`,
  `progress.md`. Deleted `frontend/components/FarmMap.tsx`,
  `frontend/app/plots/[id]/page.tsx`.
- Next best step at the time: `feat-016` (completed later in this same
  session — see below).

### Session 011 (continued) — feat-016

- Goal: Implement `feat-016` — the Farm Dashboard screen.
- Implemented `frontend/components/RecommendationCard.tsx` (reusable
  6-field card, per `ui-build-plan.md`'s explicit "reuse one card
  component" guidance — will be reused by `feat-017`/`feat-018`) and
  `frontend/app/dashboard/page.tsx`: health score, active alerts, tasks
  due today, weather, top 5 recommendations, asset status grid. Added a
  Dashboard nav link and widened the main content area
  (`max-w-3xl` -> `max-w-5xl`) for the richer grid layouts.
- Verified: `npm run build`/`npm run lint` clean. Playwright walkthrough
  (localhost origin) — zero errors, all 5 sections render. Cross-checked
  every number against the direct `GET /dashboard/summary` values
  captured during `feat-013`'s verification: health score 70, 1 active
  alert, 7 tasks due (9 pending minus the 2 approved/rejected in
  `feat-013`), exact weather match, correctly sorted top-5
  recommendations, correct per-asset scores/status.
- Result: `feat-016` moved to `passing` in `feature_list.json`.
- Files updated: `frontend/components/RecommendationCard.tsx` (new),
  `frontend/app/dashboard/page.tsx` (new), `frontend/app/layout.tsx`,
  `feature_list.json`, `progress.md`.
- Next best step: `feat-017` — the asset detail screen. This is the one
  that finally makes `/assets/{id}` a real route instead of 404ing.

## Session 012

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Goal: Implement `feat-017` — the asset detail screen (Screen 3), the
  next unfinished feature per `feature_list.json`.
- Found on session start that `frontend/app/assets/[id]/page.tsx` and a
  supporting `ApiError` class in `frontend/lib/api.ts` already existed,
  uncommitted, in the working tree from an interrupted prior session (not
  recorded in `progress.md`/`feature_list.json`). Reviewed the code
  rather than discarding it — it was substantially complete (type-specific
  sensor readings, AI analysis, prediction, recommendation cards with
  approve/reject, today's tasks, history) but had leftover `DEBUG`
  `console.log` calls and, per this session's live verification, two real
  bugs (see below).
- Cleaned up: removed the debug logging; found and deleted 3 leftover
  `*-TEST-*` `RECOMMENDATIONS` rows in the live Snowflake account (labeled
  "race-condition debugging" in their own text) left over from that
  interrupted session — real demo data pollution, not legitimate content.
- Verified (runtime, against the live account, not just build):
  - `npm run build` / `npm run lint` clean.
  - Ran `POST /workflow/run` live (91.9s) to generate 4 fresh real
    `RECOMMENDATIONS` for FP-001 (still in its critical DO crisis).
    Playwright walkthrough (localhost origin, per `feat-015`'s known CORS
    finding) confirmed: home page click-through to `/assets/FP-001`; real
    sensor values, critical risk badge, prediction card, all 4
    recommendation cards with full 6-field content; `/assets/DOES-NOT-EXIST`
    404s cleanly.
  - **Bug 1 (found + fixed):** `handleDecision()` called `load()` without
    awaiting it, then cleared `pendingId` in a `finally` block immediately
    after — re-enabling the Approve/Reject buttons on the stale
    pre-refresh card during the ~4-5s Snowflake round-trip for the
    refetch. A first walkthrough pass (run via a sub-agent) misread the
    UI as unresponsive and rapid-double-clicked, unintentionally approving
    all 4 fresh FP-001 recommendations. Root-caused with a scripted
    Playwright click-and-poll test (confirmed the POST and refetch GETs
    were correct; only the button's disabled window was too short). Fixed
    by making `load()` return its promise and awaiting it before clearing
    `pendingId`. Re-verified with the same script: button now stays
    disabled through the whole refresh; a fresh approve (2->1 pending) and
    reject (1->0 pending) each worked correctly with zero console errors.
  - **Bug 2 (found + fixed):** `READING_FIELDS_BY_TYPE` didn't match
    `asset_simulator.py`'s actual per-type fields or
    `docs/FarmTwin-AI-Copilot.md`'s "Simulated Data" spec: `chicken_coop`
    was missing `water_l` (a real chicken metric); `rice_field` wrongly
    listed `water_l` (chicken-only, always null for rice); `fruit_orchard`
    was missing `growth_stage` (which the simulator *does* generate for
    orchards) and wrongly listed `air_temp_c`/`humidity_pct` (chicken-only,
    always null for orchard). Fixed all three lists to match the vision
    doc and simulator exactly. Re-verified live: a scripted pass over all
    4 asset ids confirmed the exact expected field-label set per type with
    zero `—` placeholder dashes remaining (e.g. FO-001 correctly showed
    real growth stage `harvest ready`, consistent with `feat-014`'s
    evidence of the orchard's harvest-ready recommendation).
  - Stopped `uvicorn` and `next dev` cleanly after verification.
- Result: `feat-017` moved to `passing` in `feature_list.json` with the
  above evidence recorded.
- Files updated: `frontend/app/assets/[id]/page.tsx` (debug cleanup + 2
  bug fixes), `frontend/lib/api.ts` (picked up the pre-existing `ApiError`
  addition, no further change), `feature_list.json`, `progress.md`. Also
  deleted 3 stray test rows directly from the live `RECOMMENDATIONS` table
  (not a file change, but a live-data cleanup worth recording).
- Known side effect: FP-001's recommendation backlog was fully drained
  (all approved/rejected) as a result of live-testing the approve/reject
  flow — the next `/workflow/run` call will regenerate fresh ones since
  the pond is still critical. Not a regression; just means a fresh demo
  run should call `/workflow/run` once before showing the asset detail
  screen if pending recommendations are wanted on screen.
- Next best step: `feat-018` — the AI Copilot panel (persistent
  cross-screen recommendation feed + free-form question box wired to
  `POST /copilot/ask`), then `feat-019` (daily briefing screen rebuild).

## Session 013

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Goal: Implement `feat-018` — the AI Copilot panel (Screen 4), the
  vision doc's explicit centerpiece requirement.
- Design decision: a persistent floating-action-button + slide-over panel
  (`frontend/components/CopilotPanel.tsx`), mounted once in
  `frontend/app/layout.tsx` (the root layout, not remounted by App Router
  on client-side navigation) rather than a dedicated `/copilot` route.
  This makes conversation state genuinely survive navigating between
  screens, which is what "persistent surface... not a screen you visit
  occasionally" actually requires, not just a floating button that resets
  every time. Two sections: a read-only "Today's priorities" feed
  (reuses `RecommendationCard`, sourced from `GET /dashboard/summary`'s
  already priority-sorted `top_recommendations` -- no inline
  approve/reject, matching the existing Dashboard screen's precedent for
  the same shared component and avoiding duplicating `feat-017`'s
  action-handling logic in a second place) and a chat-style "Ask a
  question" box wired to `POST /copilot/ask`, with the vision doc's 3
  example questions as quick-select chips.
- Verified (runtime, against the live account, not just build):
  - `npm run build` / `npm run lint` clean.
  - Playwright walkthrough against live `uvicorn` + `next dev`: from `/`,
    opened the panel, confirmed the correct empty-state message when 0
    recommendations were pending (real state at the time, drained during
    `feat-017`'s live testing), asked "What should I do today?" and got a
    real grounded multi-asset answer (FP-001 critical DO crisis with full
    6-field recommendations and Q4-2024 history citations, FO-001
    correctly flagged harvest-ready, CC-001/RF-001 correctly healthy)
    ending with a concrete next step.
  - Closed the panel, used a **real client-side nav-link click** (not
    `page.goto`, which triggers a full reload and would unfairly reset
    state) to navigate to `/dashboard`, reopened the panel, and confirmed
    the prior Q&A exchange was still there -- proves true cross-screen
    persistence, not per-page state. Asked "Should I feed the fish?" from
    the dashboard screen and got a real grounded "No" answer with the
    same live data, ending with a concrete next step.
  - Triggered a fresh `POST /workflow/run` (77.4s) to generate 5 real
    pending recommendations, then confirmed the "Today's priorities"
    section renders all 5 as real `RecommendationCard`s matching
    `GET /dashboard/summary` exactly. (A first check with too short a
    wait misread this as 0 cards -- a test-script timing issue on the
    live Snowflake round-trip, not a real bug; confirmed correct on
    rechecking with a longer wait.)
  - Zero console/page errors throughout. Stopped `uvicorn`/`next dev`
    cleanly after verification.
- Result: `feat-018` moved to `passing` in `feature_list.json` with the
  above evidence recorded. **All backend features and 4 of 5 frontend
  features (`feat-008`–`feat-018`) are now `passing`** -- only `feat-019`
  (daily briefing rebuild) remains.
- Files updated: `frontend/components/CopilotPanel.tsx` (new),
  `frontend/app/layout.tsx`, `feature_list.json`, `progress.md`.
- Next best step: `feat-019` — rebuild `frontend/app/briefing/page.tsx`
  against the real `GET /briefing/today` (it currently has only the
  minimal feat-015 compat patch, not a real redesign).

## Session 014

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Goal: Implement `feat-019` — rebuild the daily briefing screen (Screen
  5), the last unfinished feature in `feature_list.json`.
- Found the data-source swap (`GET /briefing/today` against
  `RECOMMENDATIONS`) had already been done as a minimal compat patch back
  in `feat-015`. The remaining work was the deferred "proper design
  pass": replaced the bespoke compact `RecommendationRow` with the shared
  `RecommendationCard` component (full 6-field detail, consistent with
  Screens 2/3/4) plus a small approved/rejected-by-whom-and-when line via
  its existing `children` slot. Removed the stale placeholder comment.
- Verified (runtime, against the live account):
  - `npm run build` / `npm run lint` clean.
  - Approved one real pending FP-001 recommendation and rejected another
    via live API calls, then a Playwright walkthrough of `/briefing`
    confirmed correct real counts ("Approved (12)" / "Rejected (11)"),
    both just-actioned recommendations visible in the right section with
    correct decision metadata, 23 total real recommendation cards, a real
    Cortex-generated summary, and zero console errors.
  - **False-alarm investigation (documented for the record since it took
    real verification effort):** mid-session, curl/JSON terminal output
    appeared to show double-UTF-8-encoded mojibake (e.g. `â€”` instead of
    an em-dash) in some recommendation text, which looked like a real
    backend/Cortex-Agent-client encoding bug. Root-caused via three
    independent checks that bypassed the terminal-display layer (a
    direct Snowflake execute()/run_query() round-trip written to a file,
    a fresh isolated `ask_agent()` call written to a file, and a final
    Playwright DOM-text extraction of the live rendered briefing page) --
    all three showed correctly encoded characters (real em-dashes,
    degree signs, arrows) with zero corruption. The apparent corruption
    was purely an artifact of how curl's UTF-8 output renders back
    through this Windows terminal/Bash-tool pipeline in this environment,
    not a real defect anywhere in the app or stored data. One demo
    recommendation row was deleted mid-investigation based on the
    since-disproven theory (regenerable test content, not seed data --
    no real loss).
- Result: `feat-019` moved to `passing` in `feature_list.json` with the
  above evidence recorded. **All 12 roadmap features (`feat-008` through
  `feat-019`) are now `passing`** -- the FarmTwin pivot is
  feature-complete.
- Files updated: `frontend/app/briefing/page.tsx`, `feature_list.json`,
  `progress.md`.
- Next best step: no unfinished feature remains in `feature_list.json`.
  If continuing: `docs/FarmTwin-AI-Copilot.md`'s "Future Features"
  section, a fresh full end-to-end demo walkthrough across all 5 screens
  in one sitting, or hardening the per-asset transaction-rollback
  limitation noted under `feat-012`.

## Session 016 — feat-020

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Goal: Implement `feat-020` — reuse Snowflake connections instead of
  opening a fresh one per query, the root-caused fix for "dashboard
  loads slowly" from Session 015's investigation.
- Implemented: `backend/app/services/snowflake_client.py`'s
  `get_connection()` now returns a `threading.local()`-scoped
  connection, created lazily and reused across queries/requests on that
  thread (recreated only if `is_closed()`), instead of a fresh
  `connect()` + `close()` on every single call. `run_query`/`execute`/
  `execute_many` no longer close the connection after use.
- Verified (runtime, against the live account, with a genuine
  before/after comparison per the feature's own verification bar):
  - `python -m compileall app` clean.
  - Measured `GET /dashboard/summary` (4 sequential queries/request), 5
    calls each: used `git stash` to get a true baseline on the
    unmodified code, timed it, then `git stash pop` to restore the fix
    and re-timed. **Before:** 4.36s / 3.76s / 3.24s / 3.85s / 2.89s
    (consistently 3-4.4s). **After:** 1.46s on the first (cold-thread)
    call, then 0.34s / 0.46s / 0.33s / 0.34s once warm -- roughly an
    85%+ reduction after warm-up, ~3x faster even on the first cold
    call.
  - Correctness: `GET /assets` cross-checked field-for-field against a
    direct `run_query()` SELECT -- exact match. A live approve
    immediately followed by a re-fetch on the same reused connection
    correctly showed the pending count drop (2 -> 1), confirming writes
    commit and are visible immediately, no transaction leakage. Fired 8
    concurrent `GET /assets` requests and confirmed all 8 returned
    identical correct data -- the thread-local design is safe under
    concurrency.
- Result: `feat-020` moved to `passing` in `feature_list.json` with the
  above evidence recorded.
- Files updated: `backend/app/services/snowflake_client.py`,
  `feature_list.json`, `progress.md`.
- Known, documented scope limit (not fixed, matching this repo's
  precedent of accepting hackathon-scale limits): no retry/backoff if a
  connection expires server-side after a long idle period -- would
  surface as a query error on next use rather than silently recovering.
  Well outside a demo session's timespan, not worth the added
  complexity.
- Next best step: `feat-021` — shared frontend data-fetch cache/hook.

## Legacy: rice-cooperative build (superseded 2026-07-14)

The original build (15 rice farms in the Mekong Delta, real Leaflet/OSM
map, single free-text Cortex narrative, `WORK_ORDERS` approve/reject) was
fully implemented and verified — all 7 features (`feat-001`–`feat-007`)
reached `passing` with real runtime evidence (Snowflake writes, live
Cortex Agent calls, Playwright browser walkthroughs). That full evidence
trail is preserved unedited in the "Session Log" below (sessions 001–009).
`feature_list.json` no longer lists those features — the file was rewritten
around the FarmTwin pivot per the user's explicit decision (see the
2026-07-14 pivot entry above and in `docs/architecture.md`). The old
Snowflake schema (`FARMS`, `SENSOR_READINGS`, `RISK_ASSESSMENTS`,
`WORK_ORDERS`, `CROP_HISTORY`) will be dropped/replaced by `feat-008`.

## Session Log

### Session 010

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Goal: Sync project docs and the feature roadmap to
  `docs/FarmTwin-AI-Copilot.md`, which the user added to the repo as a new
  product vision doc, and flag anything ambiguous before touching
  `feature_list.json` (per the user's explicit "ask me if something make
  you confused" instruction).
- Compared the new vision doc against the current, fully-`passing` build
  (read `progress.md`, `feature_list.json`, `docs/architecture.md`,
  `docs/ui-build-plan.md`, `snowflake/coco-prompts.md`,
  `backend/app/main.py`, `backend/app/models/schemas.py`) and found 4
  direct conflicts, not additions: (1) many identical rice farms vs. one
  farm with 4 heterogeneous asset types, (2) a real Leaflet/OpenStreetMap
  Screen 1 (`feat-007`, verified working) vs. the doc's isometric
  digital-twin map, (3) free-text Cortex narratives vs. the doc's mandatory
  6-field structured recommendation format, (4) whether to keep
  `feat-001`–`feat-007` as the active feature list or rewrite it.
- Asked the user via `AskUserQuestion` rather than guessing, since these are
  high-blast-radius architectural decisions (one touches a live Snowflake
  schema, another discards verified working frontend code). User decisions,
  all confirmed 2026-07-14:
  1. **Full pivot** — rebuild around a single farm with heterogeneous
     `FARM_ASSETS` (not additive, not a hybrid).
  2. **Switch to isometric digital twin** — drop the real OSM map in favor
     of the doc's isometric asset map.
  3. **Restructure recommendations now** — Cortex Agent output must be
     parsed/returned as the 6 required fields (Recommendation/Reason/
     Evidence/Priority/Expected Impact/Confidence), not free text.
  4. **Rewrite `feature_list.json`** around FarmTwin, moving the old
     feature evidence into `progress.md` as preserved history (this
     section) rather than keeping it as the active roadmap.
- Implemented (docs/planning only — no backend or frontend code touched
  this session, per the user's request to "sync docs, create new feature
  list"):
  - Rewrote `docs/architecture.md`: new target Snowflake schema table
    (`FARM_ASSETS`, `ASSET_READINGS`, `ASSET_RISK_ASSESSMENTS`,
    `RECOMMENDATIONS`, `ASSET_HISTORY`, `WEATHER_READINGS` now farm-wide),
    explicit old-table -> new-table mapping, the Observe/Understand/
    Recommend/Predict flow diagram, and a recorded scope decision to derive
    Alerts/Tasks rather than storing them in separate tables.
  - Rewrote `docs/ui-build-plan.md`: 5 target screens (Digital Twin home,
    Farm Dashboard, Asset detail, AI Copilot panel, Daily briefing),
    the new API data contract table, and an explicitly flagged open
    technical decision (isometric rendering approach — CSS/SVG vs. a
    library) left for the implementing session rather than guessed here.
  - Rewrote `feature_list.json`: 12 new features (`feat-008`–`feat-019`),
    ordered Snowflake schema -> agent -> backend models -> simulation ->
    workflow rewrite -> endpoints -> copilot endpoint -> 5 frontend
    screens, each with dependencies and verification steps in the same
    evidence-required style as the superseded feat-001-007. Added a
    top-level `pivot_note` field explaining the rewrite and pointing back
    to this progress.md section.
  - Added "Part 2: FarmTwin asset-model rebuild" to
    `snowflake/coco-prompts.md` — draft CoCo prompts for the new schema,
    seed data, semantic view, and agent, with empty "Result" lines (not run
    yet — that's `feat-008`/`feat-009`). Kept "Part 1" (the original 5
    prompts) intact and labeled superseded, since it's a true record of
    what was actually run against the account.
  - Added a superseded banner to the top of
    `docs/Climate-Adaptive-Agriculture-Copilot-Summary.md` pointing to
    `docs/FarmTwin-AI-Copilot.md` as the new authoritative vision doc
    (kept the file itself — useful history of the pivot, not deleted).
  - Updated `README.md`'s project description and repo framing to FarmTwin
    (setup instructions unchanged — CoCo/Python/Node prerequisites still
    apply identically).
- Verification run: `python -c "import json; json.load(open('feature_list.json'))"`
  confirms the rewritten file is still valid JSON. No backend/frontend code
  changed this session, so `python -m compileall app` / `npm run build`
  were not re-run (nothing to verify at runtime yet — `feat-008` is
  `not_started`).
- Files updated: `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/ui-build-plan.md`,
  `docs/Climate-Adaptive-Agriculture-Copilot-Summary.md`, `README.md`,
  `snowflake/coco-prompts.md`, `feature_list.json`, `progress.md`.
- Known risk: the new Snowflake schema in `feat-008` has not been run
  against the live account yet — everything in `docs/architecture.md`'s
  schema table is a plan, not yet-verified reality, until `feat-008`'s
  CoCo prompts are executed and their "Result" lines filled in.
- Next best step: `feat-008` — run the Part 2 CoCo prompts against the
  live Snowflake account (this drops the old rice-farm tables; confirm
  with the user immediately before executing, since it's destructive on a
  live account) and record results in `snowflake/coco-prompts.md`.

### Session 009

- Date: 2026-07-13
- Goal: Implement `feat-007` — turn Screen 1 into a real interactive farm
  map (Leaflet + OpenStreetMap) per the user's "as real as possible"
  direction, plotting each farm at its actual lat/lon with crop/status
  info in a popup, per the new "Screen 1 v2" section written into
  `docs/ui-build-plan.md` this session before implementation began.
- Design decision (recorded in `docs/ui-build-plan.md` and confirmed with
  the user): Leaflet + OpenStreetMap, not Mapbox (no API key/account
  needed, renders the farms' real seeded coordinates) and not a stylized
  non-geo layout (explicitly rejected — user wants real geography). Map
  supplements, does not replace, the existing card list.
- Implemented:
  - Confirmed exact `FARMS` columns via a live `DESCRIBE TABLE` (not just
    trusting `coco-prompts.md`'s schema doc): `CROP_TYPE VARCHAR`,
    `PLANTING_DATE DATE`, `AREA_HECTARES FLOAT`.
  - `backend/app/models/schemas.py`: added `crop_type`, `area_hectares`,
    `planting_date` to `Plot`.
  - `backend/app/main.py::get_plots`: extended the `SELECT` to pull those
    three columns from `FARMS` and populate the new `Plot` fields.
  - `frontend`: installed `leaflet@1.9.4` + `react-leaflet@5.0.0` (the
    React-19-compatible major version) + `@types/leaflet`.
  - `frontend/components/FarmMap.tsx` (new, `'use client'`):
    `MapContainer` with `bounds`/`boundsOptions` computed via
    `L.latLngBounds` from the fetched plots (not a hardcoded center/zoom —
    stays correct if farms are added), real OSM `TileLayer` with required
    attribution, `L.divIcon` markers colored by risk level (reusing
    `RiskBadge`'s color families at higher saturation for map visibility),
    and `Popup`s showing name/crop_type/area_hectares/`RiskBadge`/a
    `next/link` to `/plots/{id}`.
  - `frontend/app/page.tsx`: wired `FarmMap` in via `next/dynamic` with
    `{ ssr: false }` (Leaflet touches `window` at module-load time, which
    breaks Next's server render pass even inside a `'use client'` page)
    plus a loading fallback matching the map's fixed height. Existing card
    list kept unchanged below the map.
- Verified (runtime, not just build):
  - `curl GET /plots` showed real values (e.g. farm 1: `"Rice - IR
    50404"`, 3.2 ha, `2026-06-01`) and a direct `SELECT` against `FARMS`
    for farms 1-3 matched the API response exactly, field for field.
  - `npm run build` and `npm run lint` both clean on the first try — no
    SSR/`window` error, confirming the dynamic-import isolation worked.
  - Playwright (chromium headless) walkthrough against live `uvicorn` +
    `next dev`: loaded `/`, confirmed 15 `leaflet-marker-icon` elements
    rendered over real OpenStreetMap tiles of the Mekong Delta/Can Tho
    region, colors matching each farm's `risk_level` (4 red/critical,
    others amber/green). Clicked a marker: popup showed "Tran Van Minh
    Farm / Rice - IR 50404 - 3.2 ha / CRITICAL / View risk assessment
    ->", exactly matching that farm's `GET /plots` data and its card-list
    entry below. Clicked the popup link and landed on `/plots/1` with the
    real Cortex risk narrative rendered. Zero console/page errors
    throughout. Screenshots captured (full page + isolated popup element,
    since the popup didn't land inside the first full-viewport crop).
  - Checked `netstat -ano | grep`-style port checks before starting both
    `uvicorn` and `next dev` this session (per session 008's note) — both
    ports were clean, no stray processes this time.
- Result: `feat-007` added to `feature_list.json` (new feature, not in
  the original 6) and moved straight to `passing` with the above evidence.
- Files updated: `docs/ui-build-plan.md` (new "Screen 1 v2" section,
  written and confirmed with the user before implementation),
  `backend/app/models/schemas.py`, `backend/app/main.py`,
  `frontend/package.json` + `package-lock.json`,
  `frontend/components/FarmMap.tsx` (new), `frontend/app/page.tsx`,
  `frontend/lib/api.ts`, `feature_list.json`, `progress.md`.
- Next best step: no unfinished feature remains in `feature_list.json`.

### Session 008

- Date: 2026-07-13
- Goal: Implement `feat-005` — scaffold `frontend/` and build the 3 screens
  from `docs/ui-build-plan.md` against the now fully-real backend.
- Read `frontend/node_modules/next/dist/docs/` first per the
  auto-generated `frontend/AGENTS.md` warning that this Next.js version
  (16.2.10) has breaking API changes vs. training data — confirmed `params`
  is a Promise in server components (not used here) and that
  `useParams()` is the correct client-component hook for the `[id]` dynamic
  segment, avoiding an async-params mistake.
- Implemented:
  - Scaffolded `frontend/` via `create-next-app` (TypeScript, Tailwind,
    App Router, ESLint). Moved the old placeholder `frontend/README.md`
    aside during scaffolding (create-next-app refuses a non-empty
    directory), then rewrote it to describe the actual 3 screens instead
    of the stale single-screen/mapbox-gl plan it previously described.
  - `frontend/lib/api.ts`: typed fetch client (`Plot`, `WorkOrder`,
    `PlotRisk`, `BriefingToday` types mirroring `backend/app/models/
    schemas.py` exactly) for all 5 endpoints, reading
    `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (`.env.local`/`.env.example` added, `.env.local`
    gitignored by the scaffold's default `.gitignore`).
  - `frontend/components/Card.tsx` + `RiskBadge.tsx`: shared across all 3
    screens per `ui-build-plan.md`'s "reuse one card component" guidance.
  - `frontend/app/plots/[id]/page.tsx` (Screen 2, built first per the
    build order): risk narrative panel + work order panel with
    Approve/Reject, calling the approve/reject endpoints and refetching.
  - `frontend/app/page.tsx` (Screen 1): plot list from `GET /plots`.
  - `frontend/app/briefing/page.tsx` (Screen 3): `GET /briefing/today`
    rendered as summary + approved/rejected lists.
  - `frontend/app/layout.tsx`: added a nav header (Plots / Daily Briefing)
    since 3 screens now need cross-navigation the default layout didn't
    have.
  - Deliberately did not install `mapbox-gl`/`recharts` from the old
    `frontend/README.md` — not needed by the actual 3-screen contract, and
    `ui-build-plan.md` explicitly says skip map tiles for this scope.
- Verified (runtime, not just build):
  - `npm run build` — clean, all 4 routes compile (`/`, `/briefing`,
    `/plots/[id]` dynamic, `/_not-found`).
  - `npm run lint` — one `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` error from a
    newer eslint-plugin-react-hooks rule on the standard fetch-on-mount
    pattern in `plots/[id]/page.tsx`; fixed with a targeted
    `eslint-disable-next-line` (the pattern itself is intentional and
    correct). Lint clean after.
  - Found a stray `uvicorn` process (PID from an earlier, not-fully-
    stopped session) already bound to port 8000 serving a stale pre-
    feat-004 build (no `/plots` route, 404). Killed it, started a fresh
    `uvicorn` against the real Snowflake account, confirmed `/plots`
    responded correctly.
  - Installed Playwright + Chromium into the session scratchpad (not a
    project dependency) and drove the full user flow headlessly against
    the live `next dev` + `uvicorn` servers: loaded `/` (all 15 plots
    rendered with correct risk badges), opened `/plots/4` (a fresh
    pending work order from a new `POST /workflow/run`), clicked Reject,
    confirmed the panel updated in place to "REJECTED ... by
    coop_manager" with a timestamp, navigated to `/briefing` and
    confirmed Plot 4's rejected order appears in the Rejected(3) list next
    to the real Cortex-generated summary text. Zero console/page errors
    across all three screens. Cross-checked via direct `curl` that
    Snowflake's `WORK_ORDERS` row actually flipped status — matches the
    UI exactly.
  - Screenshots taken at each step (plot list, risk detail before/after
    reject, briefing) confirm correct rendering in both light styling and
    layout terms.
- Result: `feat-005` moved to `passing` in `feature_list.json` with the
  above evidence recorded. All 6 features in `feature_list.json` are now
  `passing`.
- Files updated: `frontend/` (new — scaffold + `lib/`, `components/`,
  `app/page.tsx`, `app/layout.tsx`, `app/plots/[id]/page.tsx`,
  `app/briefing/page.tsx`, `.env.example`, `README.md`), `feature_list.json`,
  `progress.md`.
- Known non-blocking wart (pre-existing, not introduced this session): all
  work orders created in a single `/workflow/run` share one combined agent
  narrative as their `action` text (feat-004's known limitation) — the
  Cortex Agent itself flagged this as corrupted-looking free text when
  asked to summarize the day's work orders for `/briefing/today`. Cosmetic
  only; every field the frontend reads and displays is still real
  Snowflake data.
- Next best step: no unfinished feature remains in `feature_list.json`.

### Session 007

- Date: 2026-07-13
- Goal: Implement `feat-006` — real daily-briefing summary in
  `run_daily_workflow` step 5, plus `GET /briefing/today`.
- Implemented:
  - `backend/app/models/schemas.py`: added `BriefingToday` (date,
    approved_work_orders, rejected_work_orders, summary).
  - `backend/app/main.py`: step 5's `summary` now leads with a factual
    sentence derived from the real `farms_assessed`/`high_risk_farms`/
    `work_orders_created` counts, then the step-3 agent narrative (those
    counts themselves were already real as of feat-002/003/004 — only the
    summary text needed to change). Added `GET /briefing/today`: queries
    `WORK_ORDERS` for today's approved/rejected rows, and — when at least
    one exists — asks `FARM_OPS_AGENT` to summarize them (the semantic
    view already joins `work_orders` to `farms`, so the agent can reason
    over real approval state, not just risk data). Returns a canned
    "no work orders" message when the list is empty.
  - `backend/app/services/cortex_agent_client.py`: bumped the httpx
    timeout 60s->90s after hitting one `ReadTimeout` during verification —
    a narrow reliability fix found while testing this feature.
- Verified (runtime, not just syntax):
  - `python -m compileall app` — clean.
  - Ran uvicorn against the live account. `GET /briefing/today` (before
    any new action) already reflected the prior session's approve/reject
    (work orders 5 approved, 6 rejected — same day) with a real grounded
    narrative naming both farms. Approved work order 7 mid-session and
    re-called the endpoint: approved list correctly became `['7','5']`.
  - `POST /workflow/run`: response was `farms_assessed=15,
    high_risk_farms=['3'], work_orders_created` length 1, summary leading
    with the real counts. Queried `WORK_ORDERS` directly afterward and
    confirmed the new row (id 9, farm 3, `pending_approval`) matched the
    response exactly.
  - Hit one transient `503` from the Open-Meteo API and one `ReadTimeout`
    from the Cortex Agent during testing — both resolved on retry, neither
    is a regression in this session's code.
  - Stopped the background uvicorn process after verification.
- Result: `feat-006` moved to `passing` in `feature_list.json` with the
  above evidence recorded. All backend features (`feat-001` through
  `feat-004`, `feat-006`) are now passing.
- Files updated: `backend/app/main.py`, `backend/app/models/schemas.py`,
  `backend/app/services/cortex_agent_client.py`, `feature_list.json`,
  `progress.md`.
- Next best step: `feat-005` — scaffold `frontend/` and build the 3
  screens against the now fully-real backend.

### Session 006

- Date: 2026-07-13
- Goal: Implement `feat-004` — create `WORK_ORDERS` rows for high-risk
  farms in step 4 of `run_daily_workflow`, and add the `/plots`,
  `/plots/{id}/risk`, `/workorders/{id}/approve`, `/workorders/{id}/reject`
  endpoints per `docs/ui-build-plan.md`'s contract.
- Inspected live Snowflake schema first (`DESCRIBE TABLE`) to confirm
  column types before writing SQL: `WORK_ORDER_ID`/`FARM_ID` are
  `NUMBER(38,0)` with no identity/sequence; `RISK_ASSESSMENTS` risk columns
  use `LOW`/`MEDIUM`/`HIGH`/`CRITICAL` (uppercase, including `CRITICAL`
  which the existing `RiskAssessment` pydantic model's `Literal` doesn't
  cover) — used plain `str` fields on the new `Plot`/`PlotRisk` models
  instead of reusing that Literal.
- Implemented:
  - `backend/app/services/snowflake_client.py`: added `execute()` (single
    statement, returns rowcount) alongside the existing `execute_many()`.
  - `backend/app/models/schemas.py`: added `Plot`, `PlotRisk`,
    `ApprovalRequest` models.
  - `backend/app/main.py`: step 4 of `run_daily_workflow` now bulk-inserts
    a `WORK_ORDERS` row per high-risk farm (ID assigned via
    `MAX(WORK_ORDER_ID)+1` client-side, since there's no sequence). Added
    `GET /plots` (latest `RISK_ASSESSMENTS` row per farm via `QUALIFY`,
    overall risk = max severity of flood/drought/disease), `GET
    /plots/{id}/risk` (latest narrative + latest work order, 404 if no
    assessment exists), `POST /workorders/{id}/approve` and `/reject`
    (404 if the id doesn't exist).
- Verified (runtime, not just syntax):
  - `python -m compileall app` — clean.
  - Ran uvicorn against the live account. `WORK_ORDERS` went 0->4 rows
    (ids 5-8, one per farm 1-4) after `POST /workflow/run`, all
    `pending_approval`.
  - `GET /plots` returned all 15 farms; farms 1-4 correctly showed
    `risk_level: "critical"`, others `low`/`medium`.
  - `GET /plots/1/risk` returned the real `RISK_ASSESSMENTS` narrative +
    work order 5. `GET /plots/999/risk` correctly 404'd.
  - `POST /workorders/5/approve` (custom `approved_by`) and
    `/workorders/6/reject` (default `approved_by`) both updated
    status/approved_by/approved_at; confirmed via a follow-up `GET
    /plots/1/risk` showing the updated status. `POST
    /workorders/9999/approve` correctly 404'd.
  - Stopped the background uvicorn process after verification.
- Result: `feat-004` moved to `passing` in `feature_list.json` with the
  above evidence recorded.
- Files updated: `backend/app/main.py`, `backend/app/models/schemas.py`,
  `backend/app/services/snowflake_client.py`, `feature_list.json`,
  `progress.md`.
- Next best step: `feat-006` (daily briefing + `/briefing/today`), then
  `feat-005` (frontend), per `feat-005`'s stated dependency on `feat-006`.

### Session 005

- Date: 2026-07-13
- Goal: Implement `feat-003` — replace the `cortex_agent_client.py`
  placeholder with a real Cortex Agents REST API call, and wire step 3 of
  `run_daily_workflow` to populate `high_risk_farms` from the agent's
  actual assessment.
- Researched (WebSearch + WebFetch against docs.snowflake.com):
  - Confirmed the real Cortex Agents Run API shape for a named agent
    object: `POST /api/v2/databases/{database}/schemas/{schema}/agents/
    {name}:run`, headers `Authorization: Bearer <PAT>` +
    `Content-Type/Accept: application/json`, request body
    `{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":...}]}],
    "stream": false}`, non-streaming response
    `{"content":[{"type":"text","text":...}, ...], "status": "completed",
    ...}`.
- Implemented:
  - `backend/app/services/cortex_agent_client.py`: replaced the placeholder
    endpoint/payload with the confirmed real shape; `ask_agent()` now joins
    all `type: "text"` content items from the response.
  - `backend/app/main.py`: step 3 now queries `FARM_ID, NAME` (name needed
    to match against the agent's free-text response), calls
    `ask_agent()` with a risk-assessment prompt, and builds
    `high_risk_farms` by matching each farm's `NAME` as a substring of the
    narrative. `summary` in the returned `DailyBriefing` is now the agent's
    real narrative instead of a hardcoded string.
- Verified (runtime, not just syntax):
  - `python -m compileall app` — clean.
  - Called `ask_agent()` directly against the live `FARM_OPS_AGENT` with
    "Which farms are at high flood risk this week?" — got a real
    1099-character response correctly identifying the same 4 CRITICAL
    flood-risk farms documented in `snowflake/coco-prompts.md` step 5.
  - Ran `uvicorn` against the live account and `curl -X POST
    /workflow/run`: response was `high_risk_farms: ['1','2','3','4']` with
    a real narrative in `summary` — matches the seeded flood-risk farms
    exactly. `WEATHER_READINGS` also grew 465->480 in the same run
    (feat-002 wiring still intact).
  - Stopped the background uvicorn process after verification.
- Result: `feat-003` moved to `passing` in `feature_list.json` with the
  above evidence recorded.
- Files updated: `backend/app/main.py`,
  `backend/app/services/cortex_agent_client.py`, `feature_list.json`,
  `progress.md`.
- Next best step: `feat-004` — add `WORK_ORDERS` creation for high-risk
  farms and the plot/risk/approve/reject endpoints.

### Session 004

- Date: 2026-07-13
- Goal: Implement `feat-002` — wire real weather ingestion + Snowflake
  writes into `run_daily_workflow`.
- Implemented:
  - `backend/app/services/weather_client.py`: added `get_today_reading(lat,
    lon)`, which calls the existing `fetch_forecast` and reduces the
    Open-Meteo response to today's `rainfall_mm`, `temp_c` (avg of daily
    max/min), and `humidity_pct` (avg of today's 24 hourly readings).
  - `backend/app/services/snowflake_client.py`: added `execute_many(sql,
    seq_of_params)`, a thin `cursor.executemany()` + commit wrapper for bulk
    inserts (the existing `run_query` is read-only).
  - `backend/app/main.py`: `run_daily_workflow` steps 1-2 now query `FARMS`
    for `farm_id/lat/lon`, fetch a live forecast per farm, and bulk-insert
    into `WEATHER_READINGS`. `farms_assessed` and `summary` in the returned
    `DailyBriefing` reflect the real farm count; steps 3-5 (risk, work
    orders, real summary) are still explicitly stubbed with a TODO comment.
- Verified (runtime, not just syntax):
  - `python -m compileall app` — clean.
  - Activated `backend/venv`, ran `uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1
    --port 8000` against the real Snowflake account.
  - `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM WEATHER_READINGS` was 450 before, 465 after one
    `curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/workflow/run` (+15, one per seeded
    farm) — response `{"farms_assessed":15,...}`.
  - Queried the 5 newest rows directly: real Open-Meteo values with today's
    timestamp and `source='open-meteo'` (e.g. farm 15: rainfall_mm=16.2,
    temp_c=26.65, humidity_pct=92.08).
  - Stopped the background uvicorn process after verification.
- Result: `feat-002` moved to `passing` in `feature_list.json` with the
  above evidence recorded.
- Files updated: `backend/app/main.py`,
  `backend/app/services/weather_client.py`,
  `backend/app/services/snowflake_client.py`, `feature_list.json`,
  `progress.md`.
- Next best step: `feat-003` — confirm the real Cortex Agents REST API
  shape and wire `ask_agent()`/step 3 of `run_daily_workflow` for real.

### Session 003

- Date: 2026-07-13
- Goal: Verify `feat-001` (Snowflake objects built via CoCo), which the user
  reported as done, and confirm `backend/.env` is populated.
- Verified:
  - All 5 prompts in `snowflake/coco-prompts.md` have "Result" lines filled
    in (db/tables, seed data, semantic view, Cortex Agent, verification
    queries).
  - `backend/.env` has real (non-empty) values for `SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT`,
    `SNOWFLAKE_USER`, `SNOWFLAKE_ROLE`, `SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE`,
    `SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE`, `SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA`, `SNOWFLAKE_PAT` (checked
    presence only, not contents — file is gitignored).
  - Created `backend/venv`, ran `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    (succeeded cleanly), then ran a live query via
    `app.services.snowflake_client.run_query()` against the real Snowflake
    account for each table: `FARMS`=15, `WEATHER_READINGS`=450,
    `SENSOR_READINGS`=450, `RISK_ASSESSMENTS`=72, `CROP_HISTORY`=45 rows —
    all match the counts recorded in `coco-prompts.md`. `WORK_ORDERS`=0,
    which is expected (that table is populated by app logic in feat-004,
    not by CoCo seed data).
- Result: `feat-001` moved to `passing` in `feature_list.json` with the
  above evidence recorded.
- Files updated: `feature_list.json`, `progress.md`.
- Next best step: `feat-002` — wire real weather ingestion + Snowflake
  writes into `run_daily_workflow`.

### Session 002

- Date: 2026-07-13
- Goal: Reconcile inconsistencies across `docs/` (no product code touched).
- Found and resolved, per user decisions:
  - `architecture.md` claimed a single-screen dashboard while
    `ui-build-plan.md` planned 3 screens — confirmed 3 screens is current;
    updated `architecture.md`'s scope table/flow diagram and
    `feature_list.json` feat-004/005/006 to match `ui-build-plan.md`'s
    endpoint contract (`/plots`, `/plots/{id}/risk`,
    `/workorders/{id}/approve`, `/workorders/{id}/reject`,
    `/briefing/today`), which previously existed only in that one doc.
  - `Climate-Adaptive-Agriculture-Copilot-Idea.md` and `...-Summary.md`
    were near-duplicates with drifting details (agent names, crop scope,
    LangGraph). Folded Idea.md's unique "Farm Onboarding" section into
    Summary.md, reconciled crop scope to rice-only MVP (multi-crop is
    future direction), removed LangGraph from the stated stack (no
    LangGraph dependency exists anywhere in the actual build), marked the
    multi-agent pipeline and rich dashboard sections in Summary.md as
    future direction (MVP is one Cortex Agent + 3 screens). Deleted
    Idea.md.
  - Fixed a stale repo-folder name in `README.md`'s layout tree
    (`climate-ag-copilot/` → `climate-agriculture-copilot/`).
- Verification run: `python -c "import json; json.load(open('feature_list.json'))"`
  confirms feature_list.json is still valid JSON after edits. No code
  changed, so `python -m compileall app` was not re-run.
- Files updated: `docs/architecture.md`,
  `docs/Climate-Adaptive-Agriculture-Copilot-Summary.md`,
  `feature_list.json`, `README.md`; deleted
  `docs/Climate-Adaptive-Agriculture-Copilot-Idea.md`.
- Next best step: unchanged — `feat-001` (run the Snowflake CoCo CLI
  prompts) is still the highest-priority unfinished feature.

### Session 001

- Date: 2026-07-08
- Goal: Set up a minimal agent harness (CLAUDE.md, feature_list.json,
  progress.md, session-handoff.md, init.sh) for this hackathon repo.
- Completed: Generated harness files via
  `.claude/skills/harness-creator/scripts/create-harness.mjs`, then
  replaced placeholder content with real features derived from
  `docs/architecture.md`, `README.md`, and the existing TODOs in
  `backend/app/main.py` and `backend/app/services/cortex_agent_client.py`.
- Verification run: `bash init.sh` — `python -m compileall app` succeeded
  (syntax-only, all backend files compile).
- Evidence captured: init.sh output showing all backend/app/**/*.py files
  compiled cleanly.
- Commits: `aef504a` Initial commit: hackathon scaffold + agent harness.
- Files or artifacts updated: `CLAUDE.md`, `feature_list.json`,
  `progress.md`, `session-handoff.md`, `init.sh` (all new).
- Known risk or unresolved issue: verification is syntax-only; no
  dependencies are installed so import errors would not be caught.
- Next best step: Work `feat-001` — run the Snowflake CoCo CLI prompts and
  record results.
