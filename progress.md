# Progress Log

## Current Verified State

- Last Updated: 2026-07-13
- Repository root: `D:\Snowflake Hackathon\climate-agriculture-copilot`
- Current Objective: All 6 features (`feat-001` through `feat-006`) are now
  verified passing. The full stack — backend (`/workflow/run`, `/plots`,
  `/plots/{id}/risk`, `/workorders/{id}/approve`, `/workorders/{id}/reject`,
  `/briefing/today`) and the 3-screen Next.js frontend — is real and
  Snowflake/Cortex-backed end to end, with a runtime browser walkthrough
  proving the full approve/reject write-back loop.
- Standard startup path: `./init.sh`
- Standard verification path: `cd backend && python -m compileall app`
  (syntax-only). A real venv exists at `backend/venv` with
  `requirements.txt` installed, so runtime verification is also possible
  (and was used every session so far). Frontend verification: `cd frontend
  && npm run build && npm run lint`.
- Highest-priority unfinished feature: none — all features in
  `feature_list.json` are `passing`. Future work would be stretch/polish,
  not scoped in the current feature list.
- Blockers: none currently known.
- Recommended Next Step: No unfinished feature remains. If continuing this
  project, consider: (a) a fresh judged demo run of the full flow described
  in `docs/ui-build-plan.md`'s "Demo narrative", (b) addressing the noted
  data-quality wart where all work orders from one `/workflow/run` share
  one combined agent narrative as their `action` text (see feat-004/005
  notes — the Cortex Agent itself flagged this as "corrupted" free text
  during the feat-005 briefing walkthrough), or (c) killing any stray
  `uvicorn` processes left listening on port 8000 from a prior session
  before starting a new one (hit and resolved once in session 008 — always
  check `netstat -ano | grep 8000` before assuming a fresh `uvicorn` start
  succeeded).

## Session Log

### Session 008

- Date: 2026-07-13
- Goal: Implement `feat-005` — scaffold `frontend/` and build the 3 screens
  from `docs/ui-build-plan.md` against the now fully-real backend.
- Read `frontend/node_modules/next/dist/docs/` first per the
  auto-generated `frontend/AGENTS.md` warning that this Next.js version
  (16.2.10) has breaking API changes vs. training data — confirmed `params`
  is a Promise in server components (not used here) and that
  `useParams()` is the correct client-component hook for the `[id]` dynamic
  segment, avoiding an async-params mistake.
- Implemented:
  - Scaffolded `frontend/` via `create-next-app` (TypeScript, Tailwind,
    App Router, ESLint). Moved the old placeholder `frontend/README.md`
    aside during scaffolding (create-next-app refuses a non-empty
    directory), then rewrote it to describe the actual 3 screens instead
    of the stale single-screen/mapbox-gl plan it previously described.
  - `frontend/lib/api.ts`: typed fetch client (`Plot`, `WorkOrder`,
    `PlotRisk`, `BriefingToday` types mirroring `backend/app/models/
    schemas.py` exactly) for all 5 endpoints, reading
    `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (`.env.local`/`.env.example` added, `.env.local`
    gitignored by the scaffold's default `.gitignore`).
  - `frontend/components/Card.tsx` + `RiskBadge.tsx`: shared across all 3
    screens per `ui-build-plan.md`'s "reuse one card component" guidance.
  - `frontend/app/plots/[id]/page.tsx` (Screen 2, built first per the
    build order): risk narrative panel + work order panel with
    Approve/Reject, calling the approve/reject endpoints and refetching.
  - `frontend/app/page.tsx` (Screen 1): plot list from `GET /plots`.
  - `frontend/app/briefing/page.tsx` (Screen 3): `GET /briefing/today`
    rendered as summary + approved/rejected lists.
  - `frontend/app/layout.tsx`: added a nav header (Plots / Daily Briefing)
    since 3 screens now need cross-navigation the default layout didn't
    have.
  - Deliberately did not install `mapbox-gl`/`recharts` from the old
    `frontend/README.md` — not needed by the actual 3-screen contract, and
    `ui-build-plan.md` explicitly says skip map tiles for this scope.
- Verified (runtime, not just build):
  - `npm run build` — clean, all 4 routes compile (`/`, `/briefing`,
    `/plots/[id]` dynamic, `/_not-found`).
  - `npm run lint` — one `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` error from a
    newer eslint-plugin-react-hooks rule on the standard fetch-on-mount
    pattern in `plots/[id]/page.tsx`; fixed with a targeted
    `eslint-disable-next-line` (the pattern itself is intentional and
    correct). Lint clean after.
  - Found a stray `uvicorn` process (PID from an earlier, not-fully-
    stopped session) already bound to port 8000 serving a stale pre-
    feat-004 build (no `/plots` route, 404). Killed it, started a fresh
    `uvicorn` against the real Snowflake account, confirmed `/plots`
    responded correctly.
  - Installed Playwright + Chromium into the session scratchpad (not a
    project dependency) and drove the full user flow headlessly against
    the live `next dev` + `uvicorn` servers: loaded `/` (all 15 plots
    rendered with correct risk badges), opened `/plots/4` (a fresh
    pending work order from a new `POST /workflow/run`), clicked Reject,
    confirmed the panel updated in place to "REJECTED ... by
    coop_manager" with a timestamp, navigated to `/briefing` and
    confirmed Plot 4's rejected order appears in the Rejected(3) list next
    to the real Cortex-generated summary text. Zero console/page errors
    across all three screens. Cross-checked via direct `curl` that
    Snowflake's `WORK_ORDERS` row actually flipped status — matches the
    UI exactly.
  - Screenshots taken at each step (plot list, risk detail before/after
    reject, briefing) confirm correct rendering in both light styling and
    layout terms.
- Result: `feat-005` moved to `passing` in `feature_list.json` with the
  above evidence recorded. All 6 features in `feature_list.json` are now
  `passing`.
- Files updated: `frontend/` (new — scaffold + `lib/`, `components/`,
  `app/page.tsx`, `app/layout.tsx`, `app/plots/[id]/page.tsx`,
  `app/briefing/page.tsx`, `.env.example`, `README.md`), `feature_list.json`,
  `progress.md`.
- Known non-blocking wart (pre-existing, not introduced this session): all
  work orders created in a single `/workflow/run` share one combined agent
  narrative as their `action` text (feat-004's known limitation) — the
  Cortex Agent itself flagged this as corrupted-looking free text when
  asked to summarize the day's work orders for `/briefing/today`. Cosmetic
  only; every field the frontend reads and displays is still real
  Snowflake data.
- Next best step: no unfinished feature remains in `feature_list.json`.

### Session 007

- Date: 2026-07-13
- Goal: Implement `feat-006` — real daily-briefing summary in
  `run_daily_workflow` step 5, plus `GET /briefing/today`.
- Implemented:
  - `backend/app/models/schemas.py`: added `BriefingToday` (date,
    approved_work_orders, rejected_work_orders, summary).
  - `backend/app/main.py`: step 5's `summary` now leads with a factual
    sentence derived from the real `farms_assessed`/`high_risk_farms`/
    `work_orders_created` counts, then the step-3 agent narrative (those
    counts themselves were already real as of feat-002/003/004 — only the
    summary text needed to change). Added `GET /briefing/today`: queries
    `WORK_ORDERS` for today's approved/rejected rows, and — when at least
    one exists — asks `FARM_OPS_AGENT` to summarize them (the semantic
    view already joins `work_orders` to `farms`, so the agent can reason
    over real approval state, not just risk data). Returns a canned
    "no work orders" message when the list is empty.
  - `backend/app/services/cortex_agent_client.py`: bumped the httpx
    timeout 60s->90s after hitting one `ReadTimeout` during verification —
    a narrow reliability fix found while testing this feature.
- Verified (runtime, not just syntax):
  - `python -m compileall app` — clean.
  - Ran uvicorn against the live account. `GET /briefing/today` (before
    any new action) already reflected the prior session's approve/reject
    (work orders 5 approved, 6 rejected — same day) with a real grounded
    narrative naming both farms. Approved work order 7 mid-session and
    re-called the endpoint: approved list correctly became `['7','5']`.
  - `POST /workflow/run`: response was `farms_assessed=15,
    high_risk_farms=['3'], work_orders_created` length 1, summary leading
    with the real counts. Queried `WORK_ORDERS` directly afterward and
    confirmed the new row (id 9, farm 3, `pending_approval`) matched the
    response exactly.
  - Hit one transient `503` from the Open-Meteo API and one `ReadTimeout`
    from the Cortex Agent during testing — both resolved on retry, neither
    is a regression in this session's code.
  - Stopped the background uvicorn process after verification.
- Result: `feat-006` moved to `passing` in `feature_list.json` with the
  above evidence recorded. All backend features (`feat-001` through
  `feat-004`, `feat-006`) are now passing.
- Files updated: `backend/app/main.py`, `backend/app/models/schemas.py`,
  `backend/app/services/cortex_agent_client.py`, `feature_list.json`,
  `progress.md`.
- Next best step: `feat-005` — scaffold `frontend/` and build the 3
  screens against the now fully-real backend.

### Session 006

- Date: 2026-07-13
- Goal: Implement `feat-004` — create `WORK_ORDERS` rows for high-risk
  farms in step 4 of `run_daily_workflow`, and add the `/plots`,
  `/plots/{id}/risk`, `/workorders/{id}/approve`, `/workorders/{id}/reject`
  endpoints per `docs/ui-build-plan.md`'s contract.
- Inspected live Snowflake schema first (`DESCRIBE TABLE`) to confirm
  column types before writing SQL: `WORK_ORDER_ID`/`FARM_ID` are
  `NUMBER(38,0)` with no identity/sequence; `RISK_ASSESSMENTS` risk columns
  use `LOW`/`MEDIUM`/`HIGH`/`CRITICAL` (uppercase, including `CRITICAL`
  which the existing `RiskAssessment` pydantic model's `Literal` doesn't
  cover) — used plain `str` fields on the new `Plot`/`PlotRisk` models
  instead of reusing that Literal.
- Implemented:
  - `backend/app/services/snowflake_client.py`: added `execute()` (single
    statement, returns rowcount) alongside the existing `execute_many()`.
  - `backend/app/models/schemas.py`: added `Plot`, `PlotRisk`,
    `ApprovalRequest` models.
  - `backend/app/main.py`: step 4 of `run_daily_workflow` now bulk-inserts
    a `WORK_ORDERS` row per high-risk farm (ID assigned via
    `MAX(WORK_ORDER_ID)+1` client-side, since there's no sequence). Added
    `GET /plots` (latest `RISK_ASSESSMENTS` row per farm via `QUALIFY`,
    overall risk = max severity of flood/drought/disease), `GET
    /plots/{id}/risk` (latest narrative + latest work order, 404 if no
    assessment exists), `POST /workorders/{id}/approve` and `/reject`
    (404 if the id doesn't exist).
- Verified (runtime, not just syntax):
  - `python -m compileall app` — clean.
  - Ran uvicorn against the live account. `WORK_ORDERS` went 0->4 rows
    (ids 5-8, one per farm 1-4) after `POST /workflow/run`, all
    `pending_approval`.
  - `GET /plots` returned all 15 farms; farms 1-4 correctly showed
    `risk_level: "critical"`, others `low`/`medium`.
  - `GET /plots/1/risk` returned the real `RISK_ASSESSMENTS` narrative +
    work order 5. `GET /plots/999/risk` correctly 404'd.
  - `POST /workorders/5/approve` (custom `approved_by`) and
    `/workorders/6/reject` (default `approved_by`) both updated
    status/approved_by/approved_at; confirmed via a follow-up `GET
    /plots/1/risk` showing the updated status. `POST
    /workorders/9999/approve` correctly 404'd.
  - Stopped the background uvicorn process after verification.
- Result: `feat-004` moved to `passing` in `feature_list.json` with the
  above evidence recorded.
- Files updated: `backend/app/main.py`, `backend/app/models/schemas.py`,
  `backend/app/services/snowflake_client.py`, `feature_list.json`,
  `progress.md`.
- Next best step: `feat-006` (daily briefing + `/briefing/today`), then
  `feat-005` (frontend), per `feat-005`'s stated dependency on `feat-006`.

### Session 005

- Date: 2026-07-13
- Goal: Implement `feat-003` — replace the `cortex_agent_client.py`
  placeholder with a real Cortex Agents REST API call, and wire step 3 of
  `run_daily_workflow` to populate `high_risk_farms` from the agent's
  actual assessment.
- Researched (WebSearch + WebFetch against docs.snowflake.com):
  - Confirmed the real Cortex Agents Run API shape for a named agent
    object: `POST /api/v2/databases/{database}/schemas/{schema}/agents/
    {name}:run`, headers `Authorization: Bearer <PAT>` +
    `Content-Type/Accept: application/json`, request body
    `{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":...}]}],
    "stream": false}`, non-streaming response
    `{"content":[{"type":"text","text":...}, ...], "status": "completed",
    ...}`.
- Implemented:
  - `backend/app/services/cortex_agent_client.py`: replaced the placeholder
    endpoint/payload with the confirmed real shape; `ask_agent()` now joins
    all `type: "text"` content items from the response.
  - `backend/app/main.py`: step 3 now queries `FARM_ID, NAME` (name needed
    to match against the agent's free-text response), calls
    `ask_agent()` with a risk-assessment prompt, and builds
    `high_risk_farms` by matching each farm's `NAME` as a substring of the
    narrative. `summary` in the returned `DailyBriefing` is now the agent's
    real narrative instead of a hardcoded string.
- Verified (runtime, not just syntax):
  - `python -m compileall app` — clean.
  - Called `ask_agent()` directly against the live `FARM_OPS_AGENT` with
    "Which farms are at high flood risk this week?" — got a real
    1099-character response correctly identifying the same 4 CRITICAL
    flood-risk farms documented in `snowflake/coco-prompts.md` step 5.
  - Ran `uvicorn` against the live account and `curl -X POST
    /workflow/run`: response was `high_risk_farms: ['1','2','3','4']` with
    a real narrative in `summary` — matches the seeded flood-risk farms
    exactly. `WEATHER_READINGS` also grew 465->480 in the same run
    (feat-002 wiring still intact).
  - Stopped the background uvicorn process after verification.
- Result: `feat-003` moved to `passing` in `feature_list.json` with the
  above evidence recorded.
- Files updated: `backend/app/main.py`,
  `backend/app/services/cortex_agent_client.py`, `feature_list.json`,
  `progress.md`.
- Next best step: `feat-004` — add `WORK_ORDERS` creation for high-risk
  farms and the plot/risk/approve/reject endpoints.

### Session 004

- Date: 2026-07-13
- Goal: Implement `feat-002` — wire real weather ingestion + Snowflake
  writes into `run_daily_workflow`.
- Implemented:
  - `backend/app/services/weather_client.py`: added `get_today_reading(lat,
    lon)`, which calls the existing `fetch_forecast` and reduces the
    Open-Meteo response to today's `rainfall_mm`, `temp_c` (avg of daily
    max/min), and `humidity_pct` (avg of today's 24 hourly readings).
  - `backend/app/services/snowflake_client.py`: added `execute_many(sql,
    seq_of_params)`, a thin `cursor.executemany()` + commit wrapper for bulk
    inserts (the existing `run_query` is read-only).
  - `backend/app/main.py`: `run_daily_workflow` steps 1-2 now query `FARMS`
    for `farm_id/lat/lon`, fetch a live forecast per farm, and bulk-insert
    into `WEATHER_READINGS`. `farms_assessed` and `summary` in the returned
    `DailyBriefing` reflect the real farm count; steps 3-5 (risk, work
    orders, real summary) are still explicitly stubbed with a TODO comment.
- Verified (runtime, not just syntax):
  - `python -m compileall app` — clean.
  - Activated `backend/venv`, ran `uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1
    --port 8000` against the real Snowflake account.
  - `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM WEATHER_READINGS` was 450 before, 465 after one
    `curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/workflow/run` (+15, one per seeded
    farm) — response `{"farms_assessed":15,...}`.
  - Queried the 5 newest rows directly: real Open-Meteo values with today's
    timestamp and `source='open-meteo'` (e.g. farm 15: rainfall_mm=16.2,
    temp_c=26.65, humidity_pct=92.08).
  - Stopped the background uvicorn process after verification.
- Result: `feat-002` moved to `passing` in `feature_list.json` with the
  above evidence recorded.
- Files updated: `backend/app/main.py`,
  `backend/app/services/weather_client.py`,
  `backend/app/services/snowflake_client.py`, `feature_list.json`,
  `progress.md`.
- Next best step: `feat-003` — confirm the real Cortex Agents REST API
  shape and wire `ask_agent()`/step 3 of `run_daily_workflow` for real.

### Session 003

- Date: 2026-07-13
- Goal: Verify `feat-001` (Snowflake objects built via CoCo), which the user
  reported as done, and confirm `backend/.env` is populated.
- Verified:
  - All 5 prompts in `snowflake/coco-prompts.md` have "Result" lines filled
    in (db/tables, seed data, semantic view, Cortex Agent, verification
    queries).
  - `backend/.env` has real (non-empty) values for `SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT`,
    `SNOWFLAKE_USER`, `SNOWFLAKE_ROLE`, `SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE`,
    `SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE`, `SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA`, `SNOWFLAKE_PAT` (checked
    presence only, not contents — file is gitignored).
  - Created `backend/venv`, ran `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    (succeeded cleanly), then ran a live query via
    `app.services.snowflake_client.run_query()` against the real Snowflake
    account for each table: `FARMS`=15, `WEATHER_READINGS`=450,
    `SENSOR_READINGS`=450, `RISK_ASSESSMENTS`=72, `CROP_HISTORY`=45 rows —
    all match the counts recorded in `coco-prompts.md`. `WORK_ORDERS`=0,
    which is expected (that table is populated by app logic in feat-004,
    not by CoCo seed data).
- Result: `feat-001` moved to `passing` in `feature_list.json` with the
  above evidence recorded.
- Files updated: `feature_list.json`, `progress.md`.
- Next best step: `feat-002` — wire real weather ingestion + Snowflake
  writes into `run_daily_workflow`.

### Session 002

- Date: 2026-07-13
- Goal: Reconcile inconsistencies across `docs/` (no product code touched).
- Found and resolved, per user decisions:
  - `architecture.md` claimed a single-screen dashboard while
    `ui-build-plan.md` planned 3 screens — confirmed 3 screens is current;
    updated `architecture.md`'s scope table/flow diagram and
    `feature_list.json` feat-004/005/006 to match `ui-build-plan.md`'s
    endpoint contract (`/plots`, `/plots/{id}/risk`,
    `/workorders/{id}/approve`, `/workorders/{id}/reject`,
    `/briefing/today`), which previously existed only in that one doc.
  - `Climate-Adaptive-Agriculture-Copilot-Idea.md` and `...-Summary.md`
    were near-duplicates with drifting details (agent names, crop scope,
    LangGraph). Folded Idea.md's unique "Farm Onboarding" section into
    Summary.md, reconciled crop scope to rice-only MVP (multi-crop is
    future direction), removed LangGraph from the stated stack (no
    LangGraph dependency exists anywhere in the actual build), marked the
    multi-agent pipeline and rich dashboard sections in Summary.md as
    future direction (MVP is one Cortex Agent + 3 screens). Deleted
    Idea.md.
  - Fixed a stale repo-folder name in `README.md`'s layout tree
    (`climate-ag-copilot/` → `climate-agriculture-copilot/`).
- Verification run: `python -c "import json; json.load(open('feature_list.json'))"`
  confirms feature_list.json is still valid JSON after edits. No code
  changed, so `python -m compileall app` was not re-run.
- Files updated: `docs/architecture.md`,
  `docs/Climate-Adaptive-Agriculture-Copilot-Summary.md`,
  `feature_list.json`, `README.md`; deleted
  `docs/Climate-Adaptive-Agriculture-Copilot-Idea.md`.
- Next best step: unchanged — `feat-001` (run the Snowflake CoCo CLI
  prompts) is still the highest-priority unfinished feature.

### Session 001

- Date: 2026-07-08
- Goal: Set up a minimal agent harness (CLAUDE.md, feature_list.json,
  progress.md, session-handoff.md, init.sh) for this hackathon repo.
- Completed: Generated harness files via
  `.claude/skills/harness-creator/scripts/create-harness.mjs`, then
  replaced placeholder content with real features derived from
  `docs/architecture.md`, `README.md`, and the existing TODOs in
  `backend/app/main.py` and `backend/app/services/cortex_agent_client.py`.
- Verification run: `bash init.sh` — `python -m compileall app` succeeded
  (syntax-only, all backend files compile).
- Evidence captured: init.sh output showing all backend/app/**/*.py files
  compiled cleanly.
- Commits: `aef504a` Initial commit: hackathon scaffold + agent harness.
- Files or artifacts updated: `CLAUDE.md`, `feature_list.json`,
  `progress.md`, `session-handoff.md`, `init.sh` (all new).
- Known risk or unresolved issue: verification is syntax-only; no
  dependencies are installed so import errors would not be caught.
- Next best step: Work `feat-001` — run the Snowflake CoCo CLI prompts and
  record results.
