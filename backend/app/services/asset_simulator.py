"""Simulates realistic, evolving per-asset sensor readings.

No physical IoT exists for this build (see docs/FarmTwin-AI-Copilot.md's
"Simulated Data" section). Each call to next_reading() nudges every metric
from its *previous* value by a small bounded step rather than drawing a
fresh random value from scratch -- this is what makes readings look like a
continuous sensor stream (values drift, don't teleport) across repeated
/workflow/run calls, per the vision doc's "simulated data should behave
realistically over time."

dissolved_oxygen_mg_l gets one extra rule beyond the generic random walk:
a directional drift while the value is in a stressed or recovering range.
This isn't a scripted one-off -- it's a general "trend continues until it
crosses back into a stable band" rule -- but it's only wired up for DO
because that's the one asset-risk story the seed data (and demo narrative)
is built around; adding the same rule to every metric would be
over-engineering for a hackathon build.
