"""Rule-based risk assessment ("Understand") and short-horizon trend
projection ("Predict") for one asset's latest simulated reading.

Thresholds mirror the ones the Cortex Agent itself was instructed to use
(see snowflake/coco-prompts.md Part 2 prompt 4: "DO < 5.0 = stress, < 3.5 =
critical; water temp > 32C; disease risk > 20%"), kept in plain Python so
the Understand stage doesn't need an LLM call for every asset on every
/workflow/run tick -- only assets flagged at medium+ risk here go on to the
(slower, real) Cortex Agent call in the Recommend stage.
